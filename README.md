There are several ways to install Python and set up your computing environment. Here, I share my personal preferences.

Note: If you are running any of the notebooks on Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/) and want to install the dependencies, simply run the following code in a new cell at the top of the notebook and skip the rest of this tutorial: pip install uv

The remaining sections below describe how you can manage your Python environment and packages on your local machine.

I have been a long-time user of Conda (https://anaconda.org/anaconda/conda) and pip (https://pypi.org/project/pip/), but recently, the uv package (https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) has gained significant traction as it provides a faster and more efficient way to install packages and resolve dependencies.

I recommend starting with Option 1: Using uv as it is the more modern approach in 2025. If you encounter problems with Option 1, consider Option 2: Using Conda.
